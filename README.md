My bio___
{
📫I graduated from high school in electronics and touched on topics such as systems, telecommunications, digital and analog electronics but I discovered after graduation that I have more of a penchant for information technology.
So thanks to the cisco certifications I start working in IT.

💞️I like studying and dealing with the design, management of IT infrastructures and I am passionate
of everything that surrounds them such as networks, various operating systems, virtualization and their security.
I am very much in favor of cloud technologies which has multiple advantages, such as scalability.

🌱It offers the possibility of increase resources in real time, according to one's workload and above all for the economic gain as there is no longer necessary to maintain the hardware of your own
infrastructure and focus primarily on software.

👀Given the flexibility of the cloud, there are also benefits for users who can benefit from smart working which represents a flexible and independent way of working. I strongly believe in this type of work which aims to optimize and increase productivity and the freedom to work in any place.
 
📫My goal is always to improve and become a better professional in my industry by sharing my knowledge with others so that there is a mutual exchange. 
I am aware that my work if done with love and dedication can improve people's quality of life.
